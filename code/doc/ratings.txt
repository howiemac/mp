normally we only want to play
   - everything with a positive rating (4 or 5 stars under the old system)
or (for albums perhaps) - everything with a non-negative rating (3, 4, or 5 stars under the old system)

normally we only want to see / be aware of:
  - everything with a non-negative rating
   
If searches normally exclude all negaive ratings, then job done!
