twisted logs are stored here, as are play logs for mp

the additions folder is for new play logs from slave clones:
- these are added to the master database by calling the /add_log method from a browser
- once added they are moved into the main logs directory
- all logs in the main logs directory are essentially disposable, as plays are recorded in the mysql database
