adding audio files
--
You can use audo files of any format supported by VLC:
- create an mp_additions folder in your home directory.
- create an empty "dummy" folder (with any name you like) within this (to prevent the mp_additions folder being deleted when additions are imported)
- Put the audio files in your mp_additions folder (not in the "dummy" folder), and then click on "additions" on the home page (http://<your-mp-domain:port>/1), and your files will be added.,
